Since then, over 48 additional small-molecule kinase inhibitors have been approved, solidifying the case for kinases as a highly druggable and attractive target class. Despite the role deregulated kinase activity plays in cancer, only 8% of the kinome has been effectively “drugged.” Moreover, 24% of the 634 human kinases are understudied. We have developed a comprehensive scoring system that utilizes differential gene expression, pathological parameters, overall survival, and mutational hotspot analysis to rank and prioritize clinically relevant kinases across 17 solid tumor cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We have developed the clinical kinase index (CKI) app (http://cki.ccs.miami.edu) to facilitate interactive analysis of all kinases in each cancer. Collectively, we report that understudied kinases have potential clinical value as biomarkers or drug targets that warrant further study.}, number={7}, journal={Cell Reports.

HGSOC tumors exhibit genomic instability with frequent alterations in the protein kinome; however, only a small fraction of the kinome has been therapeutically targeted in HGSOC. Using multiplexed inhibitor beads and mass spectrometry, we mapped the kinome landscape of HGSOC tumors from patients and patient-derived xenograft models. The data revealed a prevalent signature consisting of established HGSOC driver kinases, as well as several kinases previously unexplored in HGSOC. Loss-of-function analysis of these kinases in HGSOC cells indicated MRCKA (also known as CDC42BPA) as a putative therapeutic target. Characterization of the effects of MRCKA knockdown in established HGSOC cell lines demonstrated that MRCKA was integral to signaling that regulated the cell cycle checkpoint, focal adhesion, and actin remodeling, as well as cell migration, proliferation, and survival. Moreover, inhibition of MRCKA using the small-molecule BDP9066 decreased cell proliferation and spheroid formation and induced apoptosis in HGSOC cells, suggesting that MRCKA may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of HGSOC.}, number={619}, journal={Science Signaling}, author={Kurimchak, Alison M. and Herrera-Montávez, Carlos and Brown, Jennifer and Johnson, Katherine J. and Sodi, Valerie and Srivastava, Nishi and Kumar, Vikas and Deihimi, Safoora and O’Brien, Shane and Peri, Suraj and Mantia-Smaldone, Gina M. and Jain, Angela and Winters, Ryan M. and Cai, Kathy Q. and Chernoff, Jonathan and Connolly, Denise C. and Duncan, James S.}, year={2020}, month=feb, pages={eaax8238}, language={eng} }

Despite activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway downstream of Gαq/11, there are no effective targeted kinase therapies for metastatic uveal melanoma. The human genome encodes numerous understudied kinases, also called the “dark kinome”. Identifying additional kinases regulated by Gαq/11 may uncover novel therapeutic targets for uveal melanoma. In this study, we treated GNAQ-mutant uveal melanoma cell lines with a Gαq/11 inhibitor, YM-254890, and conducted a kinase signaling proteomic screen using multiplexed-kinase inhibitors followed by mass spectrometry. We observed downregulated expression and/or activity of 22 kinases. A custom siRNA screen targeting these kinases demonstrated that knockdown of microtubule affinity regulating kinase 3 (MARK3) and serine/threonine kinase 10 (STK10) significantly reduced uveal melanoma cell growth and decreased expression of cell cycle proteins. Additionally, knockdown of MARK3 but not STK10 decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Analysis of RNA-sequencing and proteomic data showed that Gαq signaling regulates STK10 expression and MARK3 activity. Our findings suggest an involvement of STK10 and MARK3 in the Gαq/11 oncogenic pathway and prompt further investigation into the specific roles and targeting potential of these kinases in uveal melanoma.}, number={12}, journal={The Journal of Biological Chemistry}, author={Baqai, Usman and Kurimchak, Alison M. and Trachtenberg, Isabella V. and Purwin, Timothy J. and Haj, Jelan I. and Han, Anna and Luo, Kristine and Pachon, Nikole Fandino and Jeon, Angela and Chua, Vivian and Davies, Michael A. and Gutkind, J.

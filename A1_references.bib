  abstract  = "Uveal melanoma (UM) is a genetically and biologically distinct
               type of melanoma, and once metastatic there is no effective
               treatment currently available. Eighty percent of UMs harbor
               mutations in the G$\alpha$q family members GNAQ and GNA11.
               Understanding the effector pathways downstream of these
               oncoproteins is important to identify opportunities for targeted
               therapy. We report consistent activation of the protein kinase C
               (PKC) and MAPK pathways as a consequence of GNAQ or GNA11
               mutation. PKC inhibition with AEB071 or AHT956 suppressed PKC
               and MAPK signalling and induced G1 arrest selectively in
               melanoma cell lines carrying GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. In
               contrast, treatment with two different MEK inhibitors, PD0325901
               and MEK162, inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cell lines
               irrespective of their mutation status, indicating that in the
               context of GNAQ or GNA11 mutation MAPK activation can be
               attributed to activated PKC. AEB071 significantly slowed the
               growth of tumors in an allograft model of GNAQ(Q209L)-transduced
               melanocytes, but did not induce tumor shrinkage. In vivo and in
               vitro studies showed that PKC inhibitors alone were unable to
               induce sustained suppression of MAP-kinase signaling. However,
               combinations of PKC and MEK inhibition, using either PD0325901or
               MEK162, led to sustained MAP-kinase pathway inhibition and
               showed a strong synergistic effect in halting proliferation and
               in inducing apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, combining PKC and
               MEK inhibition was efficacious in vivo, causing marked tumor
               regression in a UM xenograft model. Our data identify PKC as a
               rational therapeutic target for melanoma patients with GNAQ or
               GNA11 mutations and demonstrate that combined MEK and PKC
               inhibition is synergistic, with superior efficacy compared to
               treatment with either approach alone.",

  abstract  = "Most uveal melanoma cases harbor activating mutations in either
               GNAQ or GNA11. Despite activation of the mitogen-activated
               protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway downstream of
               G$\alpha$q/11, there are no effective targeted kinase therapies
               for metastatic uveal melanoma. The human genome encodes numerous
               understudied kinases, also called the ``dark kinome''.
               Identifying additional kinases regulated by G$\alpha$q/11 may
               uncover novel therapeutic targets for uveal melanoma. In this
               study, we treated GNAQ-mutant uveal melanoma cell lines with a
               G$\alpha$q/11 inhibitor, YM-254890, and conducted a kinase
               signaling proteomic screen using multiplexed-kinase inhibitors
               followed by mass spectrometry. We observed downregulated
               expression and/or activity of 22 kinases. A custom siRNA screen
               targeting these kinases demonstrated that knockdown of
               microtubule affinity regulating kinase 3 (MARK3) and
               serine/threonine kinase 10 (STK10) significantly reduced uveal
               melanoma cell growth and decreased expression of cell cycle
               proteins. Additionally, knockdown of MARK3 but not STK10
               decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Analysis of RNA-sequencing and
               proteomic data showed that G$\alpha$q signaling regulates STK10
               expression and MARK3 activity. Our findings suggest an
               involvement of STK10 and MARK3 in the G$\alpha$q/11 oncogenic
               pathway and prompt further investigation into the specific roles
               and targeting potential of these kinases in uveal melanoma.",
